# Overview
This is the software requirements specification (SRS) document. All of the program’s requirements are defined here. These requirements help visualize how the project works and the outcome of the final program that we got. It will include the complete description and what it will look like with the functionalities it will have included.
# Software Requirements
Software requirements are helping us to define the system that we want; they give us a vision of the final product by specifying the different requirements we will need to meet at the end of the development. They are helping us to understand how the system will look like. There are two types of requirements functional and nonfunctional.
