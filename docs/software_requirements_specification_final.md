# Overview
This is the software requirements specification (SRS) document. All of the program’s requirements are defined here. These requirements help visualize how the project works and the outcome of the final program that we got. It will include the complete description and what it will look like with the functionalities it will have included.
# Software Requirements
Software requirements are helping us to define the system that we want; they give us a vision of the final product by specifying the different requirements we will need to meet at the end of the development. They are helping us to understand how the system will look like. There are two types of requirements functional and nonfunctional.
## Functional Requirements
Functional requirements describe the ways in which the program behaves.

### Keylogger
| ID  | Requirement 	|
| :-------------: | :----------: |
| FR1.1 | The program shall be able to encrypt files using the Fernet, AES, and DES3 encryption schemes |
| FR1.2 | The program shall set its encryption method based on a configuration file generated by the user |
| FR1.3 | The program shall record keystrokes and write them into a hidden text file |
| FR1.4 | The program shall encrypt the keystroke text file before it is sent to the cloud server |
|FR1.5 | Every key pressed by the user shall be logged into a text file | 

### Cloud
 
| ID  | Requirement 	|
| :-------------: | :----------: |
| FR2.1 | The target shall use a connectionless protocol (UDP-based) to send a new keylog file to the server every hour |
| FR2.2 | The server shall not send any packets to the target device |
| FR2.3 | The user shall utilize a TCP-based protocol to download files from the server, allowing for file viewing, selection, authentication, and encrypted communication |
| FR2.4 | The TCP and UDP servers shall be run independently, allowing for neither, one, or both to be run concurrently |
| FR2.5  | The cloud machine shall run the two servers automatically upon boot |

### GUI
 
| ID  | Requirement 	|
| :-------------: | :----------: |
| FR3.1 | Users shall be able to pull the encrypted text file from a remote network through the GUI |
| FR3.2 | Users shall be able to copy the generated encryption key from the configuration tab |
| FR3.3 | Users shall be able to connect to the cloud with a TCP socket and disconnect from the download tab |
| FR3.4 | The user shall be able to create a config file using the configuration tab |
| FR3.5 | The user shall be able to decrypt the downloaded encrypted file in the decrypt tab |
 
## Non-Functional Requirements
 Non-functional requirements describe the general characteristics of the system.
### Keylogger
| ID  | Requirement 	|
| :-------------: | :----------: |
| NFR1.1 |   |
| NFR1.2 | The user shall be able to choose whether the keylogger records system info, key strokes, or both |
| NFR1.3 | The target-side program shall be installable through keyboard input alone so that it may be installed via a rubber ducky or similar tool |
| NFR1.4 | The keylogger’s encryption shall be implemented securely and shall prevent decryption without the privately generated key |
| NFR1.5 | |

### Cloud
 
| ID  | Requirement 	|
| :-------------: | :----------: |
| NFR2.1 | The files sent to the server from the target shall be transmitted accurately and without errors |
| NFR2.2 | The program shall use a Google Cloud virtual machine as the remote server for file storage |
| NFR2.3 | Software shall be capable of handling multiple requests without affecting performance |
| NFR2.4 | The Google Cloud machine shall be set up to use SSH in order to prevent unauthorized access |
| NFR2.5 | Unencrypted text files received shall not be stored or saved on the cloud machine |

### GUI
 
| ID  | Requirement 	|
| :-------------: | :----------: |
| NFR3.1 | A GUI shall be used for an easy user experience |
| NFR3.2 | The GUI shall require manual entry for the server IP address and decryption key |
| NFR3.3 | The GUI shall prompt the user if no files are selected for configuration |
| NFR3.4 | The GUI shall be responsive and have minimal delays |
| NFR3.5 | The GUI shall be portable and have the ability to run as long as Python is installed |
