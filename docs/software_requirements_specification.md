# Overview
This is the software requirements specification (SRS) document. All of the programâ€™s requirements are defined here. These requirements help visualize what the outcome of the final project will look like and the functionalities it will have included.
 
# Functional Requirements
 
1. Encryption

    1. The program shall be able to encrypt in PGP encryption {F1.1}
    1. The user shall have the option to encrypt a text file using the encryption methods available to them {F1.2}
    1. Software shall encrypt the text file before it is sent to the cloud software. {F1.3}
    
1. Cloud
    1. The target shall use a connectionless protocol (UDP-based) to send a new keylog file to the server every hour {F2.1}
    1. The server shall not send any packets to the target device {F2.2}
    1. The user shall utilize a TCP-based protocol to download files from the server, allowing for file viewing, selection, authentication, and encrypted communication {F2.3}
        1. The server program shall run a TCP-based server socket hosting the directory where it stores the keylog files {F2.3.1}
        1. The server program shall enforce a user account creation upon installation on the server device {F2.3.2}
        
1. GUI
    1. Users shall be able to pull the encrypted text file from a remote network through the GUI. {F3.1} 
    
1. Keylogger
     1. Software shall collect keystrokes and place them into a hidden text file. {F4.1}
     1. Every key pressed by the user shall be logged into a text file. {F4.2}

# Non-Functional Requirements
 
1. Encryption
    1. Unencrypted text files received shall not be stored or saved on the cloud software. {NF1.1}
    2. The user shall be able to choose the type of encryption. {NF1.2}
1. Cloud
    1. The files sent to the server from the target shall be transmitted accurately and without errors {NF2.1}
    1. Communication between the server and all other devices shall be authenticated so as to prevent the unwanted upload or download of files {NF2.2}
    1. Software shall be capable of handling multiple requests without affecting performance {NF2.3}
    1. The Program shall use Google Cloud as the remote network storing the files {NF2.4}
1. GUI
    1. A GUI shall be used for an easy user experience. {NF 3.1}
1. Keylogger
    1. The target-side program shall be installable through keyboard input alone so that it may be installed via a rubber ducky or similar tool {NF4.1}
    1. The software shall be portable, as long as the target machine has Python installed. {NF4.2}
